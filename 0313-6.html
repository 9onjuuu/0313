    <h1>That's not how this works - Charlie Puth</h1>
    
    <p>Thought, the day you disappeared, that it was over
        Didn't even hear you leavin'
        Saw you with someone and thought that it was closure
        But you still tell me that you need me</p>
    
    <p>Baby, why?
        Tell me, why can't you just make up your mind?
        Quit messin' with my head</p>

    <p>You can't say you hate me, then call me when you're hurt
        Baby, you know that's not how this works
        No, that's not how this works</p>
